## My process

In a nutshell:
- First a few websites were used as inspiration for the design and a color palette was used to have some base colors to begin with that fit well together. 
- After, sections of the website were identified and the content of the website was coded in HTML. 
- I Refered to the HTML code and sections to organize the CSS and wrote out all of the elements before assigning the different properties. 
- A tiny bit of freestyle coding was done as I went along...
- I added some basic javascript and then some light animations to the make the site more intersting on a desktop when using a mouse. 
- Finally, I tested all parts of my portfolio and sent it out to get it reviewed and obtain feedback.

### What I learned

I should have made a proper design comp with a tool like Figma before begining to code. I had websites to use as inspiration but next time I know it would be easier and more efficient in the longrun to use Figma. My biggest challenges taking the approach of using a few websites as inspiration was freestyling the paddings and margins in the layout, which I wouldn't have had to do as much if I made a proper design comp first. 
I also learned how to do light animations in CSS.
